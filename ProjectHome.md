An alternative, more standard, more clean and more modern of REXML

Project aimed to build:
  * pure ruby xml parser (standard 1.0)
  * pure ruby xpath engine (standard 1.0)
  * more standards builded on top of that (schematron, xslt, sxpath, ...)

Not yet released but already implemented
  * xml pull parser (ansi C) (to be replaced by pure ruby xml parser)
  * xpath parser (ansi C) (to be replaced by pure ruby xpath parser)
  * DOM with xlinq like API
  * xpath engine
  * xquery like API
  * xupdate like API

Merciless quality
  * Developed in TDD (Test Driven Development)
  * Use Case Tests for all API (better than sloppy documentation)
  * Standard Compliancy Tests
